[Click here for PT-BR version](README.pt-br.md)

**Selah** is an application inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, but with a special twist: purposeful breaks, full customization, and automatic tracking of your productivity.

## 🍅 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique was created by **Francesco Cirillo** and involves breaking down work into short time blocks, called *Pomodoros*, interspersed with breaks. The goal is to maintain focus for short periods and ensure you get rest to avoid mental fatigue.

### How does the traditional method work?
1. **Define a task** to work on.
2. **Work for 25 minutes** without interruptions.
3. **Take a short 5-minute break.**
4. **After every 4 cycles**, take a long break (15–30 minutes).

## 🚀 What Makes Selah Different?

Selah follows the original foundation of the technique but offers extra features to supercharge your focus:

### ⚙️ Time Customization
- Set the minutes for **focus**, **short break**, and **long break** however you like.
- Just go to the settings page and adjust.

### 🔁 Smart Cycles
- The app automatically organizes the cycles and saves everything in your history.
- **Selah's Default**:
  - **Odd** cycles → Work (focus).
  - **Even** cycles → Short break.
  - **Cycle 8** → Special long break.

### 🍅 Clear Visualization
- Colored dots show you where you are in the process:
  - 🟣 Purple → Work (focus).
  - 🟡 Yellow → Short break.
  - 🔵 Blue → Long break.

### 📊 Automatic History
- Each task and cycle is recorded with a **completed** or **interrupted** status.
- Track your progress over time without needing to write anything down.
